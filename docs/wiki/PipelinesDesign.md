# Module Pipelines

This section will give you an overview of the different phases and shared logic the module pipelines use.

- [Inputs](#inputs)
- [Pipeline phases](#pipeline-phases)
- [Shared concepts](#shared-concepts)

## Module pipeline inputs

Note that the pipeline comes with 4 runtime parameters you can provide when you trigger it:
- `'Branch' dropdown`: A dropdown to select the branch to run the pipeline from
- `'Remove module' switch`: Can be set to 'true' or 'false' and controls whether the test-deployed resources are removed after testing
- `Versioning mode`: This option allows you to control the publishing behavior. Depending on the mode you select, a different part of the version is incremented (for example [major|minor|patch]), if no custom version is provided. For further information of how the input is processed see [publishing](#publish).
- `Custom version`: Allows you to provide a custom version to publish the module with. For further information of how the input is processed see [publishing](#publish).

## Pipeline phases

To "build"/"bake" the modules, a dedicated pipeline is used for each module to validate their production readiness, by:

1. **Validate**:
   1. Running a set of static Pester tests against the template
   1. Validating the template by invoking Azure’s validation API (Test-AzResourceGroupDeployment – or the same for other scopes)
1. **Test deploy**: we deploy each module by using a predefined set of parameters to a ‘sandbox’ subscription in Azure to see if it’s really working
   1. **Removal**: The test suite is cleaned up by removing all deployed test resources again
1. **Publish**: the proven results are copied/published to a configured location such as template specs, the bicep registry, Azure DevOps artifacts, etc.

<img src="./media/pipelinePhases.png" alt="Pipeline phases" height="150">

Using this flow, validated modules can be consumed by other any consumer / template / orchestration to deploy a service, workload, or entire environment such as a landing zone.

These 'ad-hoc' test pipelines are important since every customer environment might be different due to applied Azure Policies or security policies, modules might behave differently or naming conventions need to be tested and applied beforehand.

### Validate

The validation phase performs all test outside of a test deployment. This includes [static tests](#static-module-validation) regarding for example a proper documentation, as well as [simulated deployments](#simulated-deployment-validation).

#### Static module validation

This static validation executes the tests documented in the [testing](./Testing) section. Without diving into to much detail, we test aspects like a proper ReadMe documentation, a proper module folder structure, a minimum number of refresh of the leveraged of API versions and the like.

#### Simulated deployment validation

This test executes validation tests such as `Test-AzResourceGroupDeployment` using both the module's template, as well as each specified parameter file. The intention of this test is to fail fast, before we even get to the later deployment test.

However, even for such a simulated deployment we have to account for certain [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and also consider the [tokens replacement](#tokens-replacement) logic we leverage on this platform.

### Test deploy

The deployment phase uses a combination of both the module's template file as well as each specified parameter file to run a parallel deployment towards a given Azure environment.

The parameter files used in this stage should ideally cover as many scenarios as possible to ensure we can use the template for all use cases we may have when deploying to production eventually. Using the example of a CosmosDB module we may want to have one parameter file for the minimum amount of required parameters, one parameter file for each CosmosDB type to test individual configurations and at least one parameter file that tests the supported providers such as RBAC & diagnostic settings.

Note that, for the deployments we have to account for certain [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and also consider the [tokens replacement](#tokens-replacement) logic we leverage on this platform.

### Removal

The removal phase is strongly coupled with the previous deployment phase. Fundamentally, we want to remove any test-deployed resource after its test concluded. If we would not, we would generate unnecessary costs and may temper with any subsequent test. Some resources may require a dedicated logic to be removed. This logic should be stored alongside the generally utilized removal script in the `.utilities/pipelines/resourceRemoval` folder and be referenced by the `Remove-DeployedModule.ps1` script that orchestrates the removal.

Most of the removal scripts rely on the deployment name used during the preceding deployment step. Based on this name in combination with the template file path, the removal script find the corresponding deployment and removes all contained resources.

### Publish

The publish phase concludes each module's pipeline. If all previous tests succeeded (i.e. no phase failed) and the pipeline was executed in the [main\|master] branch, a new module version is published to all configured target locations. Currently we support
- _template specs_
- _private bicep registry_

By the time of this writing, the publishing experience works as follows:
1. A user can optionally specific a specific version in the module's pipeline file, or during runtime. If the user does not, a default version is used
1. No matter what publishing location we enabled, the corresponding logic will
   1. Fetch the latest version of this module in the target location (if available)
   1. Compare it with any specified custom version the user optionally provided
      - If the custom version is higher, it is used going forward
      - If it is lower, the fallback mechanism will select a new version based on some default behavior (e.g. increment to the next patch version)
   1. The identified new version is then used to publish the module to the target location in question

## Shared concepts

There are several concepts that are shared among the phases. Most notably
- [Pipeline variables](#pipeline-variables)
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Tokens Replacement](#tokens-replacement)

### Pipeline variables

The primary pipeline variable file hosts the fundamental pipeline configuration. In here you will find and can configure information such as:

#### ***General***
| Variable Name | Example Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `defaultLocation` | "WestEurope" | The default location to deploy resources to. If no location is specified in the deploying parameter file, this location is used |
| `resourceGroupName` | "validation-rg" | The resource group to deploy all resources for validation to |

#### ***Template-specs specific (publishing)***
| Variable Name | Example Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `templateSpecsRGName` | "artifacts-rg" | The resource group to host the created template-specs |
| `templateSpecsRGLocation` | "WestEurope" | The location of the resource group to host the template-specs. Is used to create a new resource group if not yet existing |
| `templateSpecsDescription` | "This is a module from the [Common Azure Resource Modules Library]" | A description to add to the published template specs |
| `templateSpecsDoPublish` | "true" | A central switch to enable/disable publishing to template-specs |

#### ***Private bicep registry specific (publishing)***
| Variable Name | Example Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `bicepRegistryName` | "adpsxxazacrx001" | The container registry to publish bicep templates to |
| `bicepRegistryRGName` | "artifacts-rg" | The resource group of the container registry to publish bicep templates to. Is used to create a new container registry if not yet existing |
| `bicepRegistryDoPublish` | "true" | A central switch to enable/disable publishing to the private bicep registry |

### Prerequisites

For both the [simulated deployment validation](#simulated-deployment-validation) as well as the [test deployment](#test-deployment) we should account for the following prerequisites:
- A _"Sandbox"_ or _"Engineering"_ **validation subscription** (in Azure) has to be used to test if the modules (or other components) are deployable. This subscription must not have connectivity to any on-premises or other Azure networks.
- An Azure Active Directory Service Principal (AAD SPN) to authenticate to the validation subscription and run the test deployments of the modules.

### Tokens Replacement

The validation or deploy actions/templates includes a step that replaces certain strings in a parameter file with values that are provided from the module workflow. This helps achieve the following:

Dynamic parameters that do not need to be hardcoded in the parameter file, and the ability to reuse the repository as a fork, where users define the same tokens in their own "repository secrets", which are then available automatically to their parameter files.

For example, some modules require referencing Azure resources with the Resource ID. This ID typically contains the `subscriptionId` in the format of `/subscriptions/<<subscriptionId>>/...`. This task substitutes the `<<subscriptionId>>` with the correct value, based on the different token types.

Please review the Parameter File Tokens [Design](./ParameterFileTokens) for more details on the different token types and how you can use them to remove hardcoded values from your parameter files.

# Platform pipelines

Outside of the previously described platform pipelines we implemented several additional pipelines to help us with some additional tasks.

- [Dependencies pipeline](#dependencies-pipeline)
- [ReadMe pipeline](#readme-pipeline)
- [Wiki pipeline](#wiki-pipeline)

## Dependencies pipeline

As the modules we test often times have dependencies to other services, we created a pipeline to deploys several standard services like VirtualNetworks and KeyVaults (alongside dummy secrets) for the modules to use. This _dependency_ pipeline should be prepared and executed before you start running any pipelines on your own. In case you need to rename any services there (for example because a certain globally unique resource name was already taken) make sure to update any references to this name in the module parameter files. You can find further details about this pipeline [here](./TestingDesign#Module-Dependencies).

### Dependencies pipeline inputs

Note that the pipeline comes with 2 runtime parameters you can provide when you trigger it:
- `'Branch' dropdown`: A dropdown to select the branch to run the pipeline from
- `'Enable SQL MI dependency deployment' switch`: Can be set to 'true' or 'false' and controls whether the dependencies for the SQL-MI are deployed during execution or not

## ReadMe pipeline

We have two major ReadMe files that we want to stay in sync with the modules in the repository. The first can be found in root (`README.md`) and the second in the modules folder (`arm/README.md`). The pipeline is triggered each time changes are pushed to the `main` branch and only if a template in the `arm` folder was altered.

Once triggered it will crawl through the library and update the tables in each corresponding ReadMe, creating links to the pipelines, adding/removing entries and so on.

## Wiki pipeline

The purpose of this pipeline is to sync any files from the `docs/wiki` folder to the GitHub wiki repository. It is triggered each time changes are pushed to the `main` branch and only if files in the `docs/wiki` folder were altered.

> **Note:** any changes performed directly on the Wiki via the UI will be overwritten by this pipeline.

# DevOps-Tool-specific considerations

Depending on what DevOps tool you want to use to host the platform you will find the corresponding code in different locations. This section will give you an overview of these locations and what they are used for.

- [GitHub Workflows](#github-workflows)

## GitHub Workflows

GitHub actions & workflows are the CI/CD solution provided by GitHub. To get the platform going, we use the following three elements:
- **Variable Files:** These file(s) contain the configuration for all module pipelines in this repository.
- **Composite Actions:** Composite actions bundle a set of actions for a specific purpose together. They are referenced by module pipelines.
- **Workflows:** GitHub workflows make up all our pipelines and leverage the _composite actions_. We have one workflow per module, plus several platform pipelines.

In the following sub-sections we will take a deeper look into each element.

### **Component:** Variable file(s)

The [pipeline configuration file](#pipeline-variables) can be found at `.github/variables/variables.module.json`.

### **Component:** Composite Actions**

We use several composite actions to perform various tasks shared by our module workflows:

- **validateModuleGeneral** <p>
  This action perform all [static tests](#static-module-validation) for a module using Pester.
- **validateModuleApis** <p>
  This action performs further [static tests](#static-module-validation), focused on API version tests for a module to ensure we notice if a version becomes stale. Each resource's API version is compared with those currently available on Azure. Accepted are both the latest 5 versions (including preview versions) as well as the latest 5 non-preview versions.
- **validateModuleDeploy:** <p>
  This action performs the [simulated deployment](#simulated-deployment-validation) using a provided parameter file.
- **deployModule:** <p>
  This action performs an [actual deployment](#test-deploy) to Azure using a provided parameter file. Once a deployment ran it [removes](#removal) the resource
- **publishModule:** <p>
  This action is capable of [publishing](#publish) the given template to a location specified in the pipeline [variable file](#component-variable-files).
- **getWorkflowInput:** <p>
  This action implements allows us to fetch workflow input values from the module's workflow file, even if the pipeline was not triggered via a `workflow_dispatch` action. Without it we would not be able to process the contained information and would need to duplicate the configuration as workflow variables.

### **Component:** Workflows

These are the individual end-to-end workflows we have for each module. Leveraging the [composite actions](#component-composite-actions) described before, they orchestrate the testing & publishing of their module.

Comparing multiple workflows you'll notice they are almost identically, yet differ in a few important areas:

- The ***path filters*** of the workflow trigger:
  - 1 for the composite actions
  - 1 of the path filters should be the relative path to the workflow itself
  - 1 should be the relative path to the module folder
  - 1 should exclude the readme
  ```yaml
    push:
      branches:
        - main
      paths:
        - '.github/actions/templates/**'
        - '.github/workflows/ms.network.virtualwans.yml'
        - 'arm/Microsoft.Network/virtualWans/**'
        - '!arm/Microsoft.Network/virtualWans/readme.md'
  ```
- The ***environment variables***
  The environment variables are leveraged by the workflow to fundamentally process the module. We need:
  - 1 variable with the module name
  - 1 variable with the relative path to the module folder
  - 1 variable with the relative path to the workflow itself
  ```yaml
  env:
    moduleName: 'virtualWans'
    modulePath: 'arm/Microsoft.Network/virtualWans'
    workflowPath: '.github/workflows/ms.network.virtualwans.yml'
  ```
- (optionally) The relative path to a ***removal script***
  As described [previously](#removal), some scripts may require custom logic to be removed. This logic should be stored in a script and be referenced by the corresponding module's workflow. To reference this script you can use the `relativePathOfRemovalScript` parameter of the `removeModule` composite action as shown below.
  ```yaml
  - name: 'Remove module'
    uses: ./.github/actions/templates/removeModule
    with:
      moduleName: '${{ env.moduleName }}'
      resourceGroupName: '${{ env.resourceGroupName }}'
      relativePathOfRemovalScript: 'utilities/pipelines/resourceRemoval/Remove-vWan.ps1'
  ```
